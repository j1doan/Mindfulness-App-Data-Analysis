# Exploratory Data Analysis: Efficiency of Mindfulness Apps

This project was completed for the class *Psychology Laboratory Topics: R* at UC San Diego, completed during the winter 2022 quarter.

In this project, I perform an exploratory data analysis on the effectiveness of mindfulness app-based training through [Headspace Health](https://www.headspace.com/). The dataset was obtained from the course instructor, [Ethan Hurwitz](https://github.com/ethanhurwitz). While the results of this EDA provide only a surface-level understanding on the effectiveness of mindfulness app-based training due to the uncertain origins of the dataset, it is better used as a demonstration of my abilities with R at the time.

This project also provides a research paper detailing the findings of the dataset used.
